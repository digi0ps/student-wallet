# Student Wallet
:atom: A Single Page Application using React with Firebase as the backend and Bulma for styling developed in a span of **4 days**. :atom:

### Pitching
:fire: As a student it's easy to lose track of money. Students prefer to track money mentally instead of using a wallet app as most of them are complex. Keeping this in mind, this wallet app is built with simplicity in mind giving students a simple, intuitive wallet app. :fire:

### Worked on
- Using Firebase's realtime database to give superfast state updates.
- Abstraction of Firebase API.
- Authentication using Firebase's phone number auth.
- Creating Bulma Components.
- Deploying website using Firebase hosting.

### Features to add down the line
- Better categories
